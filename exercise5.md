## Warum werden logger bibliotheken verwendet?
### A: Loggers are logging Code activity. This means the Programmer can issue some "Checkpoints" at specific points in his code to save various inputs, calculations or errors in a seperate file which won't be deleted or overwritten.

## Welche Loglevel gibt es in Log4J und was hat es damit auf sich?
### A:
1. ALL – To log all events.
2. DEBUG – A general debugging event.
3. ERROR – An error in the application, possibly recoverable. 
4. FATAL – A severe error that will prevent the application from continuing. 
5. INFO – An event for informational purposes. 
6. TRACE – A fine-grained debug message, typically capturing the flow through the application. 
7. WARN – An event that might possibly lead to an error. 
8. OFF – No events will be logged.
